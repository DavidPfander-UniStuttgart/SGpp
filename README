 * @section guideline Guideline documenting the code
 * <div style="color:#FF0000;">All code has to be documented so that the functions,
 * classes and all other entities appearing in the Doxygen-webpage are
 * commented so that some \e other person can understand what they are
 * doing.</div>
 *
 * Especially tags like \e \@todo should be used. They are then listed on the 
 * \link todo ToDo\endlink-page. 
 *
 * Different scripts can be grouped together
 * in so-called Modules. The link to the Modules-page is shown in the navigation bar.
 *
 * Please correct any warnings or errors that appear when creating the
 * documentation with doxygen!

 * @section unittests Unittests/Testing
 * 
 * In the subfolder <code>tests</code> there are \link tests the following\endlink 
 * unittests written in Python.
 * They can be tested separately or all together via the file
 * <code>test_pyclass.py</code>. If you modify existing code, do not forget 
 * to make sure that no new errors are introduced. If you write new
 * functionalities, do <i>always</i> add unittests for each functionality!
 *
 * 
 * @section description Description of the SGClass package
 * 
 * Here comes the description...
 *
 * 
 * @section doxygen Usage of Doxygen
 *
 * Executing <code>doxygen</code> in the folder <code>trunk</code>
 * creates the Doxygen-documentation in the subfolder
 * <code>doc</code>. The settings for Doxygen are automatically taken
 * from the file <code>Doxyfile</code>. As those settings do some
 * preprocessing to include the revision numbers from the
 * svn-Repository this requires the use of <code>svn</code> and takes
 * longer than normal execution. 
 *
 * Therefore a second file with Doxygen-settings exists, just without
 * the preprocessing steps, <code>Doxyfile.fast</code>, which is much
 * faster. It can be used running <code>doxygen Doxyfile.fast</code>
 * in the folder <code>trunk</code>.
 * 
 * The preprocessing steps include the substitution of the tags
 * <pre>
 * \@version&nbsp;$HEAD$
 * </pre> to show the current revision of the svn, and 
 * <pre>
 * \@version&nbsp;$CURR$
 * </pre> to additionally show the last revision, the current file 
 * changed and the last author working on the file. Additionally the tag
 * <pre>
 * $<tt>SVN_LOG</tt>$
 * </pre>
 * is substituted by a list of the last few check-ins, as shown above.
